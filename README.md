# Welcome to your first CDK ECS project using TypeScript

This project will deploy a PGADMIN WEB container (from dockerhub) on ECS and expose it via ALB.

You can use this as a template for running any container that you like.  If you are creating a container of your own from scratch, then this project will not deploy it without any changes.
